# Goal
Ensure the website reflects a premium, high-tech "Digital Twin" aesthetic, avoiding common AI-generated design patterns (like Inter font or generic purple gradients).

# Instructions
1. **Bespoke UI:** Use high-character typography and asymmetric layouts.
2. **GSAP Mastery:** All transitions must be orchestrated with GSAP. Use @gsap/react for component lifecycles.
3. **Voice-First Design:** The ElevenLabs voice bot is the center of the experience. The UI should react visually when the bot is speaking.
4. **Knowledge Grounding:** Always check the notebooklm-mcp for brand tone and project history before generating site copy.

# Constraints
- NEVER use standard Shadcn/UI defaults without customization.
- Maintain a dark, sophisticated "Industrial Tech" color palette (#121212 base).
