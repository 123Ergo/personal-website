## Personal Background

### Family
I'm from Toronto, Canada, and I'm 51 years old—though I'll be turning 52 on March 23, 2026. I'm married to Erica, and together we have two daughters:
- **Violet** — 5.5 years old
- **Leela** — 2.5 years old (pronounced "Leela")

### Athletic Background
I'm a former competitive hockey player with experience at both the junior and collegiate levels:
- **Junior Hockey:** I played for the St. Michael's Buzzers in Toronto (Junior A, Tier 2)
- **NCAA Hockey:** I played for Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)

My hockey background instilled discipline, teamwork, and competitive drive—qualities that have shaped my approach to business and life.

### Education
| Institution | Degree | Years | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|-------|
| **University of Western Ontario** | BA, Sociology | 1995–1997 | Completed my undergraduate studies here |
| **Rochester Institute of Technology** | B.Sc. (partial) | 1994–1995 | Played NCAA hockey during my time here |

### Health & Fitness Journey
I started walking seriously in early fall 2025. Since then, I've lost almost 40 pounds.

For 2026, I've set myself a challenge: walk 5 million steps in the calendar year. That works out to 13,699 steps per day, every single day. So far, I'm about 5 days behind schedule—but I'm determined to beat this challenge.

### Personal Interests & Easter Eggs
A few things that make me who I am:
- **I love dogs** and deeply miss my French Bulldog mix, Mimi
- **I love musicals and show tunes** — there's something about the energy and storytelling that gets me every time
- **I'm a huge Toronto Blue Jays fan** — born and raised in Toronto, so it's in my blood
- **I prefer Netflix documentaries to Netflix reality shows** — give me something I can learn from
- **My favorite comedian is Mitch Hedberg** — his deadpan delivery and one-liners are unmatched
